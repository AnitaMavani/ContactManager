## TypeFlowReactMaterial 

This is a small React application built with TypeScript, Material-UI, and Create React App. It demonstrates basic usage of Material-UI components, React hooks, and TypeScript for type safety. The app currently includes a Contact page, Login, and Register pages, with routing set up for navigation between these pages.

The project uses Material-UI's AppBar for the header design, and each page showcases different Material-UI components integrated with React functionality.
